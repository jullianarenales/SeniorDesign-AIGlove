# SeniorDesign-AIGlove
# VisionGuide Haptic Explorer

# About
The VisionGuide Haptic explorer is a collaboration between seniors from the Biomedical and Electrical Engineering departmants and Computer Science departments for the University of Arkansas Spring 2024 Capstone. The goal of this project being to create a haptic glove which with the addition of a depth sensing camera and Jetson Orin Nano running Python based software will aid visually impaired users in small object aquisition. 

This respository specifically contains the Python based software for processing camera data, running computer vision processes to detect objects, passing feedback through the glove through GPIO, and controlling microphone input to allow users to specify objects.

# Operation
## Note
This project was created with CUDA support available to optimize operations to utilize this OpenCV must be built from source with your specifc GPU architecture in mind and using Anazonda for Python is highly recommended.

## Step 1
Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/jullianarenales/SeniorDesign-AIGlove.git` 

## Step 2

TBA
